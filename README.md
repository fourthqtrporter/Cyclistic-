Cyclistic is a bike share company based out of Chicago that launched in 2016. The company offers numerous bike options including cargo bikes, tricycles and reclining bikes. This company has differentiated themselves from other ride share companies by offering bikes for individuals with disabilities.  
The company has found that paid members have generated a greater profit for them compared to pay as you go bike users. The purpose of this project is to determine what factors lead to cyclists choosing to pay for membership vs. using the casual pay as you go feature with the Cyclistic company. To address this concern, we must find out how the members and non-members use the bikes differently. The stakeholders for this project is the companyâ€™s financial analyst team and Lily Moreno, who is the director of marketing. 
 To analyze this data, we will study the Cyclistic bike share dataset. The first step I will take is review the structure of the dataset in R. Then I will have to clean our data before addressing any questions. After we clean the data, we will need to find the most appropriate model that will work with this data. Some models I have in mind are decision trees and logistic regression.
